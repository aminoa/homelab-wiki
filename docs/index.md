## Aneesh's Homelab

Welcome to my homelab! My infrastructure is spread across a cluster at home and a digital ocean droplet. If you want to learn more about the hardware that powers the supercomputer*, check out the [[Hardware]] page. Or you can check out the [[Software]] page. My online infrastructure hosts public websites which you can read about on the [[Services]] page. 

My home servers are primarily designed for media storage whereas my cloud instance is designed for public facing websites.
